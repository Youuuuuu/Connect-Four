Description of the game: (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

In order to run the program, you need to click on the 'main' file.

Description:
You will play against the computer.
At the beginning you can choose if you want to play in the console or with a GUI.
If you chose to play in the console, you have the sign 'O' and computer has the sign 'X'.
If you chose to play with the GUI, you will have the color yellow, and the computer will have the color red.
The computer will try to beat you. The goal is to win.

What I learned:
-create a game that is aware of your actions and is behaving accordingly
